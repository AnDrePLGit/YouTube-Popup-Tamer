Closes annoying YouTube popups and lets you watch without interruptions.
It also clicks "Skip Ad" button when ad comes up (mainly for leftovers after Adblock).
Does not interfere with the Adblock Plus extension.

I used many extension and they all have some defects, so i wrote one for myself, and i want to share it with you.

Works on any popup (big, small, on left and right ;) ), but in particular:
- Sign in to YouTube
- Video paused. Continue watching?
- Age confirmation
- YouTube Music ad
- Chrome ad
- Make a donation to this channel
- You are not using a YouTube account
- and probably every annoying popup YT adds later...
Cookies popup excluded.

Unlike other similar extensions:
- it shouldn't slow down your browser
- it works even if tab is not selected
- should work with future popups

Extension options:
- if you don't want information box after closing popup you can disable it
- if you don't want to skip ads you can disable it
There are also basic statistics in options.

Known issues:
- when login popup is tamed and you quickly load another video it may appear and be tamed once again (popup needs couple hundred ms to execute code)
- there are some yt functions that uses popup container and should be excluded (e.g. if you're logged in the whole menu after clicking avatar in top right corner - this one is the only one excluded for now)

Development roadmap:
- "Get the best YouTube experience, Sign in to save videos, subscribe, and more" - error message in video container
- second layer of security - actually blocking popups

This extension doesn't block popups. It "hides" them and unpause video.
If you have any suggestions write me.

This extension will always be free.
If this extension made your life a bit easier and you want it to be further developed please make tiny donation, it would mean a lot to me.
